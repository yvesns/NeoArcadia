# Neo Arcadia

My entry to the Decentraland 2019 2 week game jam.

Neo Arcadia is a social experience based on an arcade store. It has two arcade minigames that work on Decentraland's single player mode, and several disk tables that work on P2P multiplayer mode.

In terms of instantiation the rotation of the arcades is only implemented around the y axis and the rotation of the tables isn't implemented at all, since it was not necessary to the completion of the scene.

The code for Madman Racing could be cleaner, but that's the way it goes when you don't discard your prototype.
